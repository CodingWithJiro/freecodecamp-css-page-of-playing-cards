## ℹ️ A Poker Club page displaying a set of playing cards

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

A simple yet detailed web page that displays a full set of spade playing cards using semantic HTML and custom CSS styling.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

## 🔍 Overview

This project recreates a page of playing cards using only HTML and CSS. Each card contains three distinct sections: a top-left label, a center symbol display, and a bottom-right label rotated to reflect a real deck layout.

The layout leverages **Flexbox** for wrapping and alignment, and uses Unicode symbols for card values, creating a clean and organized grid of styled cards.

- Custom layout for Ace through King (♠️ suit)
- Centered Unicode symbols (♠, ♞, ♛, ♚) for realism
